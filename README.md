# Strategies for Building Trust with Automated Agents

This project explores how different conversational styles (friendly, moderate, and professional) used by AI voice agents affect user trust and experience.

We studied this by having participants interact with different agents and analyzed their responses using both quantitative (ANOVA, post-hoc tests) and qualitative (sentiment and thematic coding) methods.
