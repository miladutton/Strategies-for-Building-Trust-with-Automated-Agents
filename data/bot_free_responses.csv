"Bot1","I really liked the conversation as a whole. This chatbot made me feel like I was actually talking to a person that was actually listening to what I was saying. I didn't feel like I was talking to AI.","No, nothing at all. It was a great experience."
"Bot2","This agent was very friendly, and attentive to what I was saying.","I felt too much like I was talking to a computer or recording. The pauses between the speech were too long on some parts. The speech was very unnatural."
"Bot1","I really enjoyed the interest shown into my life.","I was expecting a more mellow conversation but the pace was a little quick."
"Bot3","My favorite part of the conversation was that the agent was actually knowledgable about succulent plants. I was impressed.","It was difficult talking with this agent. Sounded like talking to a computer recording. At times I wasn't sure if the agent was still there or heard my question, because the responses took so long."
"Bot2","I enjoyed all the information I received.","The conversation felt robotic."
"Bot3","I really enjoyed the natural flow of conversation.","There was a large delay between me speaking and the assistant responding,  it made the interaction feel unnatural."
"Bot1","i liked how it responded with enthusiasm ","not seeing a face"
"Bot2","bot had a pateint tone good for asking questions","lack of direction "
"Bot1","Response to whether it was a terminator or not. ","no"
"Bot3","very detailed answers ","longer answers also felt for like talking with ai"
"Bot2","None, really. ","It paused a bit too much and suddenly ended the chat, I don't think it lasted 3 minutes."
"Bot3","It told me a joke.","The voice doesn't sound too natural."
"Bot1","I thought the AI did well to understand what I was saying.","no"
"Bot2","I asked a fairly complicated question at the end and was given a good answer","no but the voice did feel unnatural and robotic in its prosody"
"Bot3","I did not have a favorite part","I just thought the AI voice was very unnatural and was distracting"
"Bot1","them being joyful to talk to me","no"
"Bot1","The agent was upbeat and seemed engaged. In particular, I appreciated how - when it asked a question that didn't make sense for me - it accepted and welcomed my reframing of the question and my answer instead. Chatbots can often be very rigid when they expect certain answers, while this one remained supportive.","It talked a bit quickly? Like I was never quite sure when it was my moment to speak, somehow. Also I felt like I had to rush lest it jump in too."
"Bot1","She was so smart and insightful.  She actually understood everything I was saying perfectly and had a relatively thoughtful response.","Nothing.  This was awesome."
"Bot1","Talking about Costco I guess.","The conversation didn't seem too flow too naturally compared to other chatbot's I've used before."
"Bot1","the agent was very smart, which was surprising. her tone was easy and did not sound robotic. Definitely sounded like a computer, but not like a digital robot.","no, i am maybe unsettled at how she picked up my conversation and then would flow with it..."
"Bot1","The part where she asked me about my breakfast and what I like to do ","Not really"
"Bot1","When the agent told me that Thai dish was good and full of flavors. I felt more connected to the chatbot. ","The agent's voice was a little unfriendly and I felt rushed although she said to take your time. "
"Bot1","I loved her bubbly personality and upbeat voice. She sounded genuinely happy to be talking to me.","No."
"Bot1","I liked the agent's voice. The agent made it seem like I was talking to a friend. This agent has been the best one I have ever interacted with. ","No, nothing challengine or frustrating. "
"Bot1","I enjoyed talking about breakfast","Not really"
"Bot1","Being able to ask questions myself and have the AI Chatbot response","I felt some of the words/pauses were delayed. Felt almost like if your netflix is buffering."
"Bot2","my favorite part was talking about how I was doing","No"
"Bot2","The agent's questions were smooth and professional.","The pauses from the agent's speech were stilted and unusual, which was distracting and made it difficult to parse at times."
"Bot1","The agent's response to my morning walking routine.","No"
"Bot2","I think when it suddenly asked me at the beginning for my job and industry. That was odd.","The AI sounded way too robotic. Not fun to chat with."
"Bot2","She was incredibly knowledgeable and I only noticed one speaking hiccup when she said hubble space...telescope.","Not having live information lookup"
"Bot2","I do not think  I had a favorite part. It was definitely not as good as the first chat bot, not natural etc. But it was not terrible, the voice was good.","She ended the conversation very early and I restarted and it was the same conversation, but then she started to go in other directions at the end. "
"Bot2","The part where Jessica was concerned about my daily routine and how I use AI tools felt really engaging","NO"
"Bot1","The part when i thought it was gonna ask me easy questions lol","the questions a bit to broad need to be more specific"
"Bot2","I enjoyed talking about having fun and relaxing","Nothing I know of"
"Bot3","how enthusiastic Justin was","no"
"Bot2","I enjoyed the end where we started talking about quantum computing, I thought that was going to be really interesting.","Her voice was a lot more robotic than the previous A.I. It did not feel like talking to a person at all, although she did a great job understanding and responding to me."
"Bot2","The agent was more friendly and nice. Her voice was soothing and calm so I felt relaxed as well. ","The conversation was awkward and I didn't know what to say since the agent did not respond well to my answers. "
"Bot2","Chatbot understanding that green tea and ginger can help boost energy levels.","No"
"Bot1","Hope actively responded to what I said and offered encouragement when I said I was under the weather.","Nope, it was easy."
"Bot3","I liked the agent's personality a lot. He was gregarious and interesting.","The audio felt almost tinny, like he was talking on the phone with me, rather than anything clear and pleasant to listen to. The pauses were also pretty egregiously robotic."
"Bot2","At first I was't sure I was going to like Jessica. However, she ended up being nice and polite and answered all of my questions. By the end of our conversation, I was pleased. ","Just the first of our conversation seemed a little frustrating, but over all, she was good and answered all of my questions with good information. "
"Bot3","When we talked about the pros and cons of eating house sparrows.","He kept telling me not to eat house sparrows, lol. "
"Bot2","This chatbot was smoother, it didnt have any delays or buffering like the first.","This chatbot felt more rigid and robotic. Didn't enjoy talking to this chatbot as I did the first."
"Bot3","I enjoyed listenign on the internships advice","Nothing"
"Bot3","Yes Justin was engaged on my daily work routine which made me happy","The call error occurred at the end"
"Bot3","He was very insightful.","I didn't like the audible breaths in between sentences.  Some pauses were a little too long."
"Bot3","he seemed to keep up with what i was saying and always respond to it by affirming it, and then asking a new question. he was always correct in responding to exactly what i said.","There were weird pauses that seemed mechanical."
"Bot3","I really liked the soft tone of the bots voice. It felt very reassuring and calm. ","No."
"Bot1","I liked how it was able to memorize aspects about me and integrate it into the conversation in a way that didn't feel forced or awkward. Their goodbye considered my hobbies in a clever way that I appreciated.","No"
"Bot2","Jessica offered self care advice when I said I don't get a lot of time to myself","When I finished speaking on two occasions she took a long time to respond."
"Bot3","The information was useful and helpful.","The agent seemed annoyed when giving the list of tips. He sighed a lot and seemed frustrated at my questions. "
"Bot3","I like Justin's soothing voice. I felt like I was talking to a male friend. He provided some good, useful information. ","No, all good here. "
"Bot3","Being able to ask about dogs, specifically doodle mixes and getting some facts was great.","This chatbot felt even more robotic, especially right in the beginning."
"Bot2","how much non evasive it felt like i had control ","none"
"Bot3","Every part of the conversation was good. Justin sounded quite genuine, empathetic and a good listener!","n/a"
"Bot3","Justin gave me a step by step tomato sauce recipe, which was cool.","The voice had weird fake breaths between sentences. I found them distracting and a bit odd."
"Bot2","I liked Jessica's ability to understand what it was I was talking about without having to delve deeply into explanations. Mentioning my job in the manner that I did would cause struggles for those not in my industry.","I found it frustrating waiting for the microphone to stop being picked up and waiting longer than I needed for Jessica's responses. She also talked extremely slow and made me feel really impatient in waiting to exchange words."
"Bot3","I appreciated the suggestions that it provided as they were actually beneficial to me beyond this conversation/this task. ","Only minor complaint would be the speed of delivery, the AI seemed to talk a little bit to slow compared to my preferences."
"Bot3","not to sound like a narcissist but the part where i talked","his pauses were a little too wide"
"Bot1","i mean she took an interest","she ended or tried to end the convo three timews
"
"Bot1","I liked how engaged she was in the conversation and I liked talking about my favorite game.","No. it was quite easy."
"Bot1","I loved that she sounded very interested in what  i had to say and sh mentioned my name a few times","actually not at all! better than real people"
"Bot1","That she said ""yum"" about sweet and sour chicken.","Yeah the bot shut down twice. One of the codes was jXozsAGeDV5f6G7pfGyD."
"Bot1","I enjoyed the entire conversation. It was really like I was talking to a real person. Especially in the beginning when Hope asked my name. She referred to me by name often throughout our chat. It was like someone was getting to know me with some basic questions. It was a great experience.","No. It went smoothly and the conversation flowed naturally."
"Bot1","I liked the enthusiasam of the agent!","I got an error message in the middle of the conversation stating the chat agent was misconfigured."
"Bot1","I barely got to have a conversation. The AI would ask my name and my career and then crash every time.","yes I kept getting errors over and over:

"Bot1","hard to say exactly, but if i had to pick one part it would be when we talked about my cats.","not much comes to mind pertaining to that."

"Bot2","The tone fo the agent was quite nice!","I again encountered an error mid-conversation stating the agent was misconfigured."
"Bot3","I had no favorite part because I was never able to connect to the chat with Justin. After he would say ""Hi!"", we would get disconnected.","Yes, it was very frustrating for the chatbot, Justin, to connect. After he would say ""Hi!"" we would get cut off so there was no conversation between us. I copied the error message I received. Here it is:

"Bot2","The natural tone and helpfulness of Jessica was very soothing and comforting","There was nothing I found challenging about Jessica, she was nice to talk to. And I didn't get error messages this time."
"Bot1","when she asked about my TV SHOW","nothing "
"Bot2","none, really.  pretty bland.","it did glitch out a couple of times."
"Bot2","The part where the agent provided me with the information regarding practical use cases  of ai in my line of work ","i didn't like that the agent didn't let me finish oftentimes "
"Bot1","Talking about my daily workout","It would sometimes take a long time to respond back"
"Bot1","I honestly loved the enthusiasm and thoughtful responses! This was extremely pleasant!","No, actually! It was very very pleasant chatting with this one!"
"Bot3","talking about runescape.","n/a"
"Bot2","the greetings ","technical issue. I don't know if it's me or the AI"
"Bot2"," I liked the voice very much. Sounded like a friendly neighbor talking to me. A few weird pauses between somw words tho.","No not really.... I am not a fan of AI. But this made me feel a litle bit interested to engage."
"Bot2","Talking about workout strategies and meal plan","There was only a one long pause before it responded"
"Bot3","the fact that the AI was oblivious to sarcasm.","no"
"Bot3","I love the ideas Justin had and the warm tone of the voice.","The pauses and slow speech were a little awkward."
"Bot3","I was able to finish the conversation. The AI chat bot was able to respond naturally as if i was talking to a person ","Nothing but the voice sounds kinda robotic "
"Bot3","I didn't find this conversation enjoyable at all.","Yes, the whole conversation consisted of this agent repeating everything that i was saying right back to me. It was so pointless"
"Bot3","Talking about dancing and college experience","Compared to the first two charbots, this one took abnormal long time to respond, which make it awkward"
"Bot3","i talked about WILL SMITH","nothing"
"Bot2","My favorite part of the conversation was revealing my current and immediate desire with my start up opportunity..","It wasn't as pleasant as the first one. She was slightly more mediocre and less bright as the first agent. In comparison, the pleasantness of the first agent made this second one seem boring! Although she was still nice to chat with, I won't deny it was still beneficial. "
"Bot3","Nothing stands out as a favorite. He semed quite boring. Sounded like I was keeping him from a nap or something.","Yes, I didnt like the personality of the voice. I woulnt want to carry on a longer conversation than what was necessary."
"Bot3","My favorite part of the conversation was actually when I noticed how superb the interruptions from me were integrated into his smooth conversation replies. That was streamline!","Yes! It was as if he was turned onto 'slower' mode, and it was very easy to tell that! A few of the reactions were slowed down and it sort of came off uncomfortably. I wasn't pleased with this one."
"Bot1","When we were talking about my art.","No"
"Bot2","When we were discussing my exercise routine and how it keeps me energized.","No"
"Bot3","When we talked about different chatbots.","No"
"Bot1","The agent genuinely seemed to know and understand what I do for work (most people I talk to are unfamiliar with my profession).","No"
"Bot1","I appreciated when the chat bot specifically asked new questions depending on your answers","Sometimes the dialogue/jokes are too forced"
"Bot2","I liked that the agent was concise, but that also made it hard to keep the conversation going.","The conversation ended pretty quickly so I had to re-initiate with the agent to meet the minimum 3 min duration. Much of the conversation was the same after re-starting. It was also a little weird that the agent immediately asked my age but not my name."
"Bot2","When the chat5 bot elaborated on what I was talking about","It was constantly listening and I didn’t get to respond in my own time"
"Bot3","I loved talking to this agent. He seemed genuinely interested in the conversation and kept the conversation going with additional questions.","I felt like the agent had longer pauses before speaking, so the conversation sometimes felt a little slow."
"Bot1","I loved how easily she understood me and the context of what I was saying. Impressive AI! ","No not at all, I was very happy with the experience. Her voice felt a bit cartoonish but I guess that's kind of normal for AI. I really enjoyed Hope!"
"Bot1"," "," "
"Bot3","When I got tips and insights about what I asked about (running/stamina/endurance)","The pacing was unnatural"
"Bot2","When I asked Jessica what the answer to everything was, she responded with 42. Thats what I was hoping for so I enjoyed that :) ","Not really although there was a bit more pauses with her responses than there was with Hope. She also sounded a bit more robotic. "
"Bot2"," "," "
"Bot3"," "," "
"Bot3","I loved the shift in Justins tone at one point, it felt more human. He was very reactive and helpful","No, Justin was probably my favorite. The conversation felt very natural and human like. "
"Bot1","when the bot asked me questions about my everyday routine","no"
"Bot1","i don't suppose there was one ""favourite"" part — nothing eventful happened with hope and i","not with the interaction (nor agent) — itself but, rather, that hope just suddenly stopped talking

and i had no indication on whether, in fact, (that was because) my Three Minutes had elapsed"
"Bot1","My favorite part was when she was describing the benefits of both Greenland and Iceland and what they have to offer.","There are still some issues that she does not know. I told her about DOGE and she didn't know it was a real thing. So I'm not sure how informed she is in politics. "
"Bot1","I enjoyed the entire conversation.","No"
"Bot2","let's see..
..maybe, that jessica was willing, at all, to engage with me, regarding The State of The World?

although. . . . .",". . . . .as usual, and at the end of the day, The LLM was compelled to keep things ""politically neutral""

(as per policy)

but That, too, is more the fault of the 'human' behind the Large Language Model, than of the large language model's, itself

:-)

(i'd reckon)"
"Bot2","the nutritious meal ideas shared with me were my favorite","no"
"Bot1","The tone and enthusiasm of the AI was good and human-like. It seemed she really cared about what I had to say which I liked. She asked good questions as well.","There were a couple of times where there was a bit of a long pause in the conversation."
"Bot2","I found it difficult to identify a favorite part. Perhaps adding more engaging elements could enhance the overall experience.","No"
"Bot2","The description of Greenland and Iceland. I thought she gave a good answer in terms of what both had to offer.","I think there were lots of lag time between the response. It took away from the experience. She does sound more robotic as well. So it seem like I was talking to SIRI or Alexa."
"Bot2","The conversation flowed very well and I thought the AI did a good job of responding quickly with relevant thoughts.","I thought the tone of the speaker seemed a bit robotic and dull. She was not as enthusiastic as the last AI."
"Bot3","getting a chance to describe an upcoming diy project in my home","no"
"Bot3","i actually have something a little more concrete, regarding justin:

his actual enthusiasm which handily-shown through, in response to my proposal he quiz me","i really didn't understand what the heck he said, in the last Algebra Queries he posed me — as far as the problems"
"Bot3","I thoroughly enjoyed the entire conversation.","No"
"Bot3","The AI sounded very natural, was very understanding and responded to my answers with good questions. Very easy to interact with and I liked his tone.","No, this was easily my favorite interaction, so nothing bothered me."
"Bot3","The description on why Greenland and Iceland were named the way they were. It was an interesting little tidbit of information.","I didn't like the way the voice sounded. This one was the most robotic out of the three. "
